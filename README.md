# heartstroke_detection
using Machine learning algorithms and real time Data from kaggle Detecting heart stroke
Heart stroke is considered as one of the leading health problems in todayâ€™s world and
death rate is high for this disease and WHO declared nearly 10 million people die each year for this
disease and causes of this stroke are lifestyle, stress, age, smoking, drinking and few other key factors
and health sector must tackle this situation by early notice to patients the suggestion of this research
is to avoid early heart attacks.The importance of machine learning for this project is to
analyze the hidden patterns. machine learning gives the early approach of heart attack detection by
application of algorithms of logistic regression, decision tree and random forest for data of the patient
