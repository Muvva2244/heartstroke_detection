1.INTRODUCTION - using Machine learning algorithms and real time Data from kaggle Detecting heart stroke
Heart stroke is considered as one of the leading health problems in todayâ€™s world and
death rate is high for this disease and WHO declared nearly 10 million people die each year for this
disease 

2.FACTORS - causes of this stroke are lifestyle, stress, age, smoking, drinking and few other key factors

3.NEED - health sector must tackle this situation by early notice to patients the suggestion of this research
is to avoid early heart attacks.

4.APPROACH - The importance of machine learning for this project is to analyze the hidden patterns. machine learning
gives the early approach of heart attack detection byapplication of algorithms of logistic regression, decision tree 
and random forest for data of the patient
